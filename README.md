## Description

* The main goal of this project is to make an E-commerce-Site for games in which the user can search, select and buy games. Each game will have an image, title and small description.

* Most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. By focusing on data and user demands we create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge.

## Contents

* This project built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save game searches to the back end.  

## Installation

## Usage 

* This application can be used by anyone wants to search games, save the search, see the available games, have some information about each game and buy games.
